1. Remove strings which are all-caps

2. When waiting for a dynamic element to load, use an empty `waitForAllFields` 
followed by `pause`

3. Use `type` to input a string in a drop-down menu (not always necessary)

4. Don't use `deselectPopUp`, `select`, `waitForPopUp`, `selectWindow`, 
`getExpression`

5. When there's a hidden element which has to be clicked (like an element in a
dropdown menu), put a `mouseMove` action with target referring to the button
which has to be hovered-over in order for the dropdown to appear

6. Don't redirect the tests to sites other than the tested one

7. Check for strings with trimmed witespace. Don't use `link` with them.
   Example:
     'още за  ' contains two witespace characters at the end. Selenium trims
        them and breaks the tests. Check Credo_search_hospital_dropdowun

     още за => 'още за  '

     or

     МБАЛ Св. София => ' МБАЛ Св. София  '
