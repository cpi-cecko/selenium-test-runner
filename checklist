1. Instead of using `link` to click on links, use xpath like the following
`//a[contains(text(),'...']`.

2. When waiting for a dynamic element to load, use an empty `waitForAllFields` 
followed by `pause`

3. Use `type` to input a string in a drop-down menu (not always necessary)

4. Don't use `deselectPopUp`, `select`, `waitForPopUp`, `selectWindow`, 
`getExpression`

5. When there's a hidden element which has to be clicked (like an element in a
dropdown menu), put a `mouseMove` action with target referring to the button
which has to be hovered-over in order for the dropdown to appear

6. Don't redirect the tests to sites other than the tested one
