1. Instead of using `link` to click on links, use xpath like the following
`//a[contains(text(),'...']`.

2. When waiting for a dynamic element to load, use an empty `waitForAllFields` 
followed by `pause`

3. Use `type` to input a string in a drop-down menu (not always necessary)

4. Don't use `deselectPopUp`, `select`, `waitForPopUp`, `selectWindow`, 
`getExpression`

5. When there's a hidden element which has to be clicked (like an element in a
dropdown menu), put a `mouseMove` action with target referring to the button
which has to be hovered-over in order for the dropdown to appear.

Always include the type of the locator in `mouseMove`.

NOTE: Sometimes there are non-obvious hidden elements. To be sure, export the 
tests to Perl, run them and see if an element could not be clicked because it's
hidden. Such an element should be fixed.

NOTE: Put `waitForAllFields` after clicking on an element in a dropdown.

6. Don't redirect the tests to sites other than the tested one
